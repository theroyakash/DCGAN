# DCGAN
(GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

## Training and Results:
Training for 50 epochs from the start:

Going forward and going 500 more epochs after result goes like this.
