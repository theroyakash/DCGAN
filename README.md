# DCGAN
(GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

If you don't know what GANs are check out this cool MIT video [here](https://youtu.be/rZufA635dq4) by Ava, or checkout the original GAN paper here ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)). She (Ava) did a very good job explaining the innerworkings of a GAN.

## Training and Results:
Training for 50 epochs from the start:

Going forward and going 500 more epochs after result goes like this.
